So, we want to build an SQLite database for this application. What do we need to do?

1. Create a database.
 - "jdbc:sqlite:C:\\Users\\Cameron\\sqlite\\sqlite3\\db\\" + fileName
 - Make fileName = "inverted-index.db"
 - Or just make it in DB Browser...
 - Then create a table(s).
  >  InvertedIndex (many-many)
   # word (primary)
   # docID (primary)
   # location (will vary)
 
2. Take the part-r-0000X files and add them to the tables via SQL INSERT statements.
 - That might be tough... or will it?
 - I'll need the ability to read through a gzip file, extract the information and add it to the table.
 
3. Make it accessible via SQL SELECT statements.
 - This is the easy part... sort of.
 - So, use Javascript, or JSP's?
